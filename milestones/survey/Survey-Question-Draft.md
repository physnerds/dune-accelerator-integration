Draft for the Survey Questions
This survey aims to gather input on data models, memory management, and performance bottlenecks to help prioritize which algorithms to accelerate in the DUNE workflow and guide improvements to accelerator integration strategies.

### Algorithm Identification: Which of the following algorithm types in your workflow do you believe are the best candidates for accelerator integration?
(Select all that apply)

- [ ] Data filtering and selection
- [ ] Signal processing
- [ ] Reconstruction
- [ ] Pattern recognition 
- [ ] Other (please specify)

### Algorithm Bottlenecks: Which algorithms in your current workflow experience the most significant performance bottlenecks that could benefit from accelerator integration?  
(Select all that apply)

- [ ] Data I/O operations
- [ ] Preprocessing or transformation algorithms
- [ ] Post-processing tasks
- [ ] Other (please specify)

### Do you have any examples or case studies where accelerating a particular algorithm significantly improved performance?
