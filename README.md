# DUNE-accelerator-integration
Accelerator Integration for the DUNE Experiment

This project shall cover the milestones related to the **Accelerator Integration** for the **Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE)** as outlined in the DUNE software and computing roadmap.
The project conducts the survey related to accelerator integration in the DUNE experiment and later use the survey to integrate accelerators in the DUNE workflow while minimizing compute resources, time etc. 

# Milestones

### Survey among current (Proto) DUNE developers to identify existing tasks/algorithms and data model in the workflow that utilize the accelerators.

###  Investigate existing tasks/algorithms in the current (Proto) DUNE workflow to identify bottlenecks in terms of I/O and compute time.

### Develop guidelines and examples of accelerator friendly data models based on the survey results and investigations

### Test framework to facilitate the design of accelerator friendly data models. The framework should be standalone. The properties of test data products and the design of data models should align with the DUNE core framework requirements.

### Determine Portability

### Identify algorithms widely used by LArTPC experiments, within LArsoft

### While finalizing the framework needs, work within the existing framework and port algorithms to a functional paradigm

### Deliver a guidebook (cook book) with examples on transform, reduction operations
